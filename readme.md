###1. Install
1. Copy the whole rslidar directory into ROS workspace, i.e "~/catkin_ws/src".

2. Checkt the file attributes:
'''
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/rslidar
chmod 777 cfg/*
'''

3. Then to compile the source code and to install it:
'''
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
'''
	
**Atttenthion: **you may encounter the error the express "can not find the rslidarPic.h" when you compling the source code, then just use "catkin_make" again, it will pass the compiling. Because the .h files are generated by the .msg files, they may not gernerated before compling the input.cc.

###2. Configure PC IP
By default, the RSLIDAR is configured the **192.168.1.200** as its device IP and **192.168.1.102** as PC IP that it would communicate. The default port is 6677 as RSLIDAR port number, while 6699 as the PC port number.
So you need configure your PC IP as a static one **192.168.1.102**.

'''
roscore
'''

2. Open a new terminal and run:
'''
rosrun rslidar rslidar_node
'''

3. Open a new terminal and run:

'''
rviz
'''

Then add a PointCloud2 topic, set the fix frame to "rslidar" and the  PointCloud2 topic name as "fullscan", you will see the point cloud data.

###3. Run and view offline pcap data
1. Open a new terminal and run:

'''
roscore
'''

2. Open a new terminal and run:

'''
rosrun rslidar rslidar_node _pcap:="the abosolute path to your pcap file"
'''

3. Open a new terminal and run:

'''
rviz
'''

Then add a PointCloud2 topic, set the fix frame to "rslidar" and the  PointCloud2 topic name as "fullscan", you will see the point cloud data.
